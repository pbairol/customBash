One of my Personl Favorite Projects, created my own custom bash. This project was inspired from what I have learned in CSC 246: Operating Systems.

Get Started:
To get started with working on the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository
2. CD into the working directory src
3. Run make

Our shell will support three built-in commands. These are listed below. For these, the shell will just
check the â€€rst word of the command. 

Using the Program:
If it's "\cd", the shell will run the built-in cd command. 
If it's \exit 0", the shell will run the built-in exit command. 
The stash can run all the valid shell comands such as:
ls, ls -l, rm, mkdir, etc ..
If the input line is empty, the shell will just ignore
the command and prompt the user again.
